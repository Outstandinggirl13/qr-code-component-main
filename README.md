## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

First steps in Frontend development and I am exploring HTML semantic tags :slightly_smiling_face:. My code is more like a mix of non-semantic and semantic elements, so it could probably be modified for the better.

```html
    <section>
        <img>
        <div>
            <h1></h1>
            <p></p>
        </div>
    </section>
```
This time I used an asterisk (*) in the CSS because I needed a universal selector to remove all the default margins and padding. It turned out to be very helpful.
```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```


### Continued development

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Typescript

### Useful resources

- [HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This helped me understand what semantic elements are.
